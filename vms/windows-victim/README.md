# Windows Victim Virtual Machine

We will be attacking the MiniShare webserver on a Windows host. This is easiest if performed on Windows XP, but can be peformed on any version of Windows. The [Windows EMET tool](https://aka.ms/emetdownload) can be used to disable DEP and ASLR protections for the purposes of the lab.

To keep everyone on the same page, we will be using the English edition of Windows XP SP3. With the SHA1 sum of  `1c735b38931bf57fb14ebd9a9ba253ceb443d459`.

Note: If you are participating in the course a virtual machine will be provided for you.
