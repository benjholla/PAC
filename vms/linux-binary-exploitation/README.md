# Binary Exploitation Live CD

A nice distribution for learning binary exploitation is provided free by NoStarch press at: [https://www.nostarch.com/hackingCD.htm](https://www.nostarch.com/hackingCD.htm). The download is a torrent file (included in this directory) that downloads a Live Linux distribution ISO with an MD5 hash of `bd7a7dfa2e0ce37e3115cdd8f3830783`. The ISO is a live Linux distribution that can be loaded in a virtual machine and installed, however it [it does not play well with VMWare players](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28782063/cannot-boot-because-kernel-panic-not-syncingfatal-exception-interrupt). So it is recommended to use VirtualBox to build this virtual machine.

## VirtualBox Setup Instructions
1. Build the VM by creating a new 32bit Linux VM with at least 512MB
2. Set the VM optical drive to IDE via Storage > Controller IDE > Optical Drive (click CD icon) > Browse to hacking-live-.10.iso ISO
3. Enable VM shared clipboard and drag and drop integrations via Settings > General > Advanced > (Enable Bidirectional Shared Clipboard, Enable Bidirectional Drag'n'Drop)
4. Start the virtual machine
5. Disable the mouse integration via Input > Mouse Integration
6. Double click the install shortcut link and follow install instructions
